#
# This file is used to put any user defined actions on the right
# button menu. Each action consists of two lines. A button title line
# and a action specification line:
#
#   Button Title
#   action spec
# 
# There are (currently) three ways to specify an action:
#
#   Webster
#   GET:http://a.site.with.webster/cgi-bin/websterquery?q=__string__
#
#   Search Engine
#   POST:http://a.site.with.webster/cgi-bin/websterquery q=__string__# 
#
#   Fetch Selection
#   FETCH:__string__
#
#   What GET does:
#     This is for a search form that is of the GET method, clicking on the
#     Webster button (in User pull_right menu) will send the selected text
#     to this cgi query and Mosaic will pull up the results. 
#
#   What POST does:
#     This is for a search form that is of the POST method, clicking on the
#     "Search Engine" button (in User pull_right menu) will send the selected
#      text to this cgi query and Mosaic will pull up the results.
#
#   What FETCH does:
#     This just treats the selection like a url and fetches it.
#
# Here is a working example (for uiuc domain only, uncomment this if you 
# are in the domain and ever feel like looking up words you find surfing)
#
# Webster
# GET:http://www.uiuc.edu/cgi-bin/oed?__string__ 
#
# How you use it:
#
# 1) Copy this file to your home directory.
# 2) Start up Mosaic (2.7b3 or greater).
# 3) Select some text. (First or second button drag in Mosaic)
# 4) Click on third button, go down to "User" sub menu and select one.
# 5) Watch the results come flying over the net and send a message to
#    mosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu saying how awesome this feature is.
#    We thank you for your support.
#
# One thing that might be useful to know if you have problems with this
# feature is that it you need to add quotes to a selection of more than 
# one word but you can't have quotes in a url so add %22's around __string__
# in the spec line if the button is meant to accept selections of more than 
# one word (see provided functions).
#
# Note: With Mosaic 2.8b1 you will be able to do construct these
# user defined actions within Mosaic via a preferences dialog. 
# This will mean you don't have to rerun Mosaic if you add a new action.
# This file is a temporary thing and will be obsolete with 2.8b1 
# (all though if you have this file 2.8b1 will read it and 
# put it in preferences and then erase it).
