=========================
Section One: Introduction
=========================

First you will need to edit the Makefile for your OS. The toplevel makefile
simply calls one of the specific makefiles located in the directory
"makefiles". Its purpose is to enable a quick way of using the correct
makefile for people who recompile Mosaic again and again. It also facillitates
adding a new platform. There are two ways to use the toplevel makefile: First
you can manually specify "make <OS>" where <OS> is one of the items listed
when you type "make help" or "make list" or you set the environment variable
"DEV_ARCH" (developer architecture) to one of the same items. Of course, this
assumes you have made the necessary adjustments to the makefile of your
choice. In the near future we intend to implement autoconf (GNU) which should
solve _everyone's_ problems.

=========================
Section Two: Step-by-Step
=========================

1) Edit "makefiles/Makefile.OS" (issue "make list" from toplevel to see
	a list of supported OSs). See Section Three for more information.
2) Compile any external libraries you need (from what you selected in your
	Makefile.OS.
3) Install Mosaic in your favorite thrid party directory.
4) Start up Mosaic and READ THE RELEASE NOTES! There have, no doubt, been
	tremendous strides forward!

Section Three: The Makefile.OS
==============================

What I am going to do is simply include Makefile.solaris-24 and explain each
part. To save space, only the configurable section is included. My comments
are noted by:

Comment
:::

----------------------------Makefile.solaris-24------------------------------
# Toplevel Makefile for NCSA Mosaic.

# You shouldn't need to touch any of the Makefiles in the various
# source subdirectories if you configure this Makefile correctly.

# If you need to make serious changes to get Mosaic to compile on your
# platform, send context diffs to mosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu.

# -------------------------- CUSTOMIZABLE OPTIONS ----------------------------

prereleaseflags = -DPRERELEASE
:::
SWP
---
The prereleaseflags variable should not be modified as it allows us to set the
correct version as well as dictating whether or not the comment card is
active.
:::

RANLIB = /bin/true
#### On non-SGI's, this should be ranlib.
# RANLIB = ranlib
:::
SWP
---
The RANLIB variable should be set according to whether or not your system
needs to have libraries ranlibed.
:::

#CC = cc
#### On Sun's, this should be gcc (ANSI required).
CC = gcc
:::
SWP
---
Set your compiler here. If you use something other than one of the two
listed, make it so, otherwise comment one or the other out.
:::

#### Linker Flags -- Primarily for linking static on linux-elf.
#ldflags = -static
ldflags =
:::
SWP
---
This is where you stick anything extra for linking. This will only affect the
final link of Mosaic (not building libraries).
:::

#### For a few files in the source, some compilers may need to be kicked
#### in K&R mode.  E.g., on SGI's, -cckr does this.
# knrflag = -cckr
#### On most systems, no flag is needed.
knrflag =

SWP

This does exactly what the comment above says. It is used on every compile.
:::

#### Random system configuration flags.
#### --> *** For Motif 1.2 ON ANY PLATFORM, do -DMOTIF1_2 *** <--
#### For IBM AIX 3.2, do -D_BSD
#### For NeXT, do -DNEXT
#### For HP/UX, do -Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE
#### For Dell SVR4, do -DSVR4
#### For Solaris, do -DSVR4 -DSOLARIS
#### For Esix 4.0.4 and Solaris x86 2.1, do -DSVR4
#### For Convex whatever, do -DCONVEX
#### For SCO ODT 3.0, do -DSCO -DSVR4 -DMOTIF1_2
#### For Motorola SVR4, do -DSVR4 -DMOTOROLA -DMOTIF1_2
sysconfigflags = -DSOLARIS -DSVR4 -DMOTIF1_2 -DSOLARIS24
:::
SWP

This is used to pass in weird system flags...basically, if they aren't defined
or defined correctly for your system to not barf on the source code, add it
here. This is given to every compile line.
:::

#### System libraries.
# syslibs = -lPW -lsun -lmalloc
#### For AIX 3.2
# syslibs = -lPW -lbsd
#### For most other Motif platforms:
# syslibs = -lPW
#### For Sun's and Ultrix and HP and BSD/386:
# syslibs =
#### For Sun's with no DNS:
# syslibs = -lresolv
#### For SCO ODT:
# syslibs = -lPW -lsocket -lmalloc
#### For Dell SVR4:
# syslibs = -lnsl -lsocket -lc -lucb
#### For Solaris (2.x)  --nsl does not link correctly staticly.
syslibs = -lnsl /usr/lib/libsocket.a /usr/ccs/lib/libgen.a
#### For Motorola SVR4:
# syslibs = -lnsl -lsocket -lgen
:::
SWP
---
These are any additional libraries needed (system libs only).
:::

#### X include file locations -- if your platform puts the X include
#### files in a strange place, set this variable appropriately.  Else
#### don't worry about it.
#### HP X11R4 version:
# xinc = -I/usr/include/Motif1.1 -I/usr/include/X11R4
#### HP X11R5 version:
# xinc = -I/usr/include/Motif1.2 -I/usr/local/X11R5/include
#### NeXT version:
# xinc = -I/usr/include/X11
#### BSD/386
# xinc = -I/usr/X11/include
#### Solaris 2.x (Patched X11R5 and Motif libs)
xinc = -I/usr/openwin/include -I/usr/dt/include
:::
SWP

This is where you specify where you have installed your X libraries. Some 
systems have everything off of /usr/lib, some are not so lucky. If you
are compiling and you get an error of "can't find include file XXX.h" it is
more than likely a problem here (or if you don't have a particular lib
installed.
:::

#### X library locations.
# xlibs = -lXm_s -lXmu -lXt_s -lX11_s
#### For Sun's (at least running stock X/Motif as installed on our machines):
# xlibs = /usr/lib/libXm.a /usr/lib/libXmu.a /usr/lib/libXt.a /usr/lib/libXext.a /usr/lib/libX11.a -lm
#### For HP-UX 8.00:
# xlibs = -L/usr/lib/Motif1.1 -lXm -L/usr/lib/X11R4 -lXmu -lXt -lX11
#### For HP-UX 9.01: The X11R5 libraries are here on our systems
# xlibs = -L/usr/lib/Motif1.2 -lXm -L/usr/lib/X11R5 -L/usr/lib/X11R4 -lXmu -lXt -lX11
#### For NeXT:
# xlibs = -L/usr/lib/X11 -lXm -lXmu -lXt -lX11
#### For Dell SVR4:
# xlibs = -L/usr/X5/lib -lXm -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11
#### For Solaris (2.x) (Use static to go from machine to machine)
xlibs = -L/usr/openwin/lib -L/usr/dt/lib -R/usr/dt/lib -lXm
xlibs += /usr/openwin/lib/libXmu.a /usr/openwin/lib/libXt.a
xlibs += /usr/openwin/lib/libXext.a -lX11
xlibs += /usr/lib/libm.a
#### For SCO ODT 3.0 (I'm told that -lXtXm_s is *not* a typo :-):
# xlibs = -lXtXm_s -lXmu -lX11_s
#### For nearly everyone else:
# xlibs = -lXm -lXmu -lXt -lX11
#### For BSD/386:
# xlibs = -L/usr/X11/lib -lXm -lXmu -lXt -lX11
#### For Motorola SVR4:
# xlibs = -lXm -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm

This is where you specify exactly what X libraries to link in and in what
order (Yes, it matters. List the libraries in dependent order.).
:::

#### DTM AND HDF SUPPORT; READ CAREFULLY

#### If you want to compile with DTM and HDF support, you should leave
#### the following lines uncommented and make sure you have a copy of
#### HDF 3.3 (r1 or later) installed and ready.  You can find HDF on
#### ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /HDF.

#### If you do not want to compile with DTM and HDF support, comment
#### the following lines out.  (If you are compiling from source for
#### the first time, you should probably not bother with HDF and DTM
#### support.)

#### dtmmachtype needs to be set to one of the following:
####   sun, sgi, dec, ibm, next, cray, convex
#### If your platform is not one of the above, then either do not compile
#### with HDF/DTM support or try hacking libdtm/makefile.

dtmmachtype = solaris
dtmdirs = libdtm libnet
dtmlibs = ../libnet/libnet.a ../libdtm/libdtm.a
dtmflags = -DHAVE_DTM -I.. -I../libnet
hdfdir = /hdf2/install/solaris
hdflibs = $(hdfdir)/lib/libmfhdf.a $(hdfdir)/lib/libdf.a
hdfflags = -DHAVE_HDF -DHDF -I$(hdfdir)/include
:::
SWP
---
This is one of those external libraries you will need to obtain if you want
HDF support (there is no real purpose for building the dtm libs unless you
use HDF. If you are not going to use it, comment it out.
:::

#### PNG SUPPORT
#### For inline PNG support, the following should be defined:
#### The libraries currently used are PNGLIB 0.81 and ZLIB 0.95

pngdir = /xdev/mosaic/libpng/solaris-24
pnglibdir = $(pngdir)/lib
pngincludedir = $(pngdir)/include
pnglibs = $(pnglibdir)/libpng.a $(pnglibdir)/libz.a -lm
pngflags =  -I$(pngincludedir) -DHAVE_PNG
:::
SWP
---
This is one of those external libraries you will need to obtain if you want
PNG support. Comment it out if you aren't going to use it.
:::

#### JPEG SUPPORT
#### For inline JPEG support, the following should be defined:
#### The library used is Independent JPEG Group (IJG's) 5.0a.

jpegdir = /xdev/mosaic/libjpeg/solaris-24
jpeglibs = $(jpegdir)/lib/libjpeg.a
jpegflags = -I$(jpegdir)/include -DHAVE_JPEG
:::
SWP
---
This is one of those external libraries you will need to obtain if you want
JPEG support. Comment it out if you aren't going to use it.
:::

#### KERBEROS SUPPORT
####
#### If you want Mosaic to support Kerberos authentication, set the 
#### following flags appropriately.  You can support Kerberos V4 and/or V5,
#### although it's most likely that your realm supports one or the other.
#### To enable DES-encryption of HTTP messages via Kerberos key exchange, 
#### define the KRB-ENCRYPT flag.

##krb4dir   = /usr/athena
#krb4dir   = /xdev/mosaic/libkrb4/solaris-24
#krb4libs  = $(krb4dir)/lib/libkrb.a $(krb4dir)/lib/libdes.a
#krb4flags = -DKRB4 -I$(krb4dir)/include

##krb5dir   = /krb5
#krb5dir   = /xdev/mosaic/libkrb5/solaris-24
#krb5libs  = $(krb5dir)/lib/libkrb5.a $(krb5dir)/lib/libcrypto.a $(krb5dir)/util/et/libcom_err.a
#krb5flags = -DKRB5 -I$(krb5dir)/include -I$(krb5dir)/include/krb5

#Do not comment out.
krbflags  = $(krb4flags) $(krb5flags)
krblibs   = $(krb4libs) $(krb5libs) 
:::
SWP
---
This is one of those external libraries you will need to obtain if you want
KERBEROS 4 or 5 (you can have both) support. If you do not want to use it,
comment out the first two groups, but not the group that expressly tells you
to leave it alone.
:::

#### DIRECT WAIS SUPPORT

#### If you want to have Mosaic be able to communicate directly with
#### WAIS servers, do set the following flags appropriately.  We
#### recommend linking with CNIDR's freeWAIS 0.5 distribution; other
#### WAIS distributions may work but we have not tested them with
#### Mosaic.  freeWAIS 0.5 can currently (Sept.1995) be found at
#### ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/wais/servers/freeWAIS 

#### If you do not wish to link to the WAIS libraries, then comment
#### the following lines out.  Mosaic will then communicate with WAIS
#### servers via a HTTP gateway.

#### -lm is required for freeWAIS 0.5, as ceil() is used.

waisroot = /xdev/mosaic/freeWAIS/solaris24
waisflags = -DDIRECT_WAIS -I$(waisroot)/include
waislibdir = $(waisroot)/bin
waislibs = $(waislibdir)/inv.a $(waislibdir)/wais.a $(waislibdir)/libftw.a -lm
:::
SWP
---
This is one of those external libraries you will need to obtain if you want
WAIS support. Comment it out if you don't want it.
:::

#### Customization flags:
#### . If you want Mosaic to come up with monochrome colors by default,
####   use -DMONO_DEFAULT
#### . If you want to define the default Mosaic home page, set
####   -DHOME_PAGE_DEFAULT=\\\"url\\\"
#### . If you want to define the default Mosaic documentation directory
####   (should be a URL), set -DDOCS_DIRECTORY_DEFAULT=\\\"url\\\"
#### . Other things you can define are spelled out in src/mosaic.h.

# ---------------------- END OF CUSTOMIZABLE OPTIONS -------------------------
---------------------------Makefile.solaris-24--------------------------------

And that should be all you need to know about our Makefiles. Again, if you
make modifications to it for support on your OS, please send in patches so
we can support your platform.

========================
Section Four: Disclaimer
========================

The Makefiles provided are done so with the following intentions:

	o They are used to compile the Mosaic binaries that NCSA provides.
	o They are meant to be used as _guidelines_ for others who wish
		to compile Mosaic for themselves.
	o They do _not_ compile all of the necessary libraries.
	o They _will_ require editing to work for your system. Each config-
		urable section explains what it is and what it expects.
	o They are _not_ guarunteed to work.

Note that the file "Makefile" is now simply a mechanism for calling the
correct Makefile. This is due in large part to the finger
of Tom Lane who very pointedly pointed out that if it does not compile Mosaic
for all of the platforms, it shouldn't be there! No, this is not intended as
a slight to Tom...we simply had not thought it through.

Another note...the 2.8 distribution tree will be drastically changing. Do not
expect patches for 2.7x to work for 2.8x. We will be moving the libraries
out of the distribution tree and into a "library" distribution along with
pointers to completely external libs (jpeg, png, zlib, etc). Since we have 
these libs in binary form, we will probably distribute a "binary_libs" archive
of all the libs we build with for each platform (for those who can't get the
lib to build or simply don't care to take the time, but still want to play
with the source to Mosaic).

The last note is for future reference. As a side project we have been playing
with autoconf (ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu). Please take into
account that these are side projects which would certainly make life easy,
but since these Makefiles suffice for us it is our intention to focus our
efforts on more important features. HOWEVER, if someone out there in the
great space wishes to perform this feat for us, we would gladly accept.
