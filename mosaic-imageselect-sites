# Image delay-loading - selection by URL substring
#
# This file should be located in your HOME directory under the filename:
#   .mosaic-imageselect-sites
#
# This file consists of lines that begin with a # (comment), blank lines,
# or lines that start with "delay" or "kill."
#
# What this file does for you is to allow you select by URL substring 
# which sites you want "delay of image loading" or "image killing" on. 
# 
# For a substring you pick "delay" for, all the images on any site with 
# the specified substring will be replaced with a little icon telling 
# you that there is an image there, but it won't be displayed, or even 
# retrieved. You could click on that little icon and get the image if 
# you later desire. 
# 
# For a substring you pick "kill" for, all the images 
# on any site with the specified substring will be replaced by a little 
# 8x8 pixel transparent image - you won't even see the "delayed-image" icon.
# 
# This can be handy for getting rid of the graphics on any page which 
# you know you won't ever want to see or even load the graphics for...
#
# These are some examples. You probably want to change these, as they 
# will probably do either too much or too little...
